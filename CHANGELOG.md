## [0.1.0] - 2020-06-18
First commit after removing the plugin from the built-in plugins of Pogo.

### Changed
- **WARNING: Breaking changes!**
- Renamed everything to match Flare's rebranding to Rive.  That is: FlareComponent, FlarePrefab, and FlareParticle, are now RiveComponent, RivePrefab, and RiveParticle.  Moving this plugin out of Pogo's core seemed as good a time as any to keep up with this questionable rebranding.
